I'm ready (woo hoo) Life is sweet as honey Yeah, this beat cha-ching like money, huh Disco overload, I'm into that, I'm good to go I'm diamond, you know I glow up Hey, so let's go 'Cause I-I-I'm in the stars tonight So watch me bring the fire and set the night alight (hey) Shining through the city with a little funk and soul So I'ma light it up like dynamite, whoa oh oh.</div>

            <div class="lyric four" id="24">The traveller is always leaving town He never has the time to turn around And if the road he's taken isn't leading anywhere He seems to be completely unaware The traveller is always leaving home The only kind of life he's ever known When every moment seems to be a race against the time There's always one more mountain left to climb Days are numbers (days) Watch the stars (are numbers) We can only see so far Someday, you'll know where you are (know where you are) Remember, days are numbers (days) Count the stars (are numbers) We can only go so far One day, you'll know where you are (know where you are) The traveller awaits the morning tide He doesn't know what's on the other side But something deep inside of him keeps telling him to go He hasn't found a reason.</div>
