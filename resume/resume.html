				<h3>Dear Manager,</h3>
				<h3>I am very glad to have the opportunity to introduce myself. My name is Seungkyun Kim and I have just obtained my Computer Programming diploma from Algonquin College with honours (Jan. 2021). I would like to apply for the position in your company. </h3>
				<h3>Among the various program languages I learned during my studies, the most interesting subject for me was web program languages. (including web publishing, front-end, back-end). The web program languages I learned at school were somewhat limited, so I have been continuing to study this field myself through online tutorials. I have gained much knowledge in HTML5, CSS, Java Script, Jquery and PHP by creating my own portfolio. Since graduation, I have created three web sites (one back-end, two front-end) and I continue adding to them.</h3>
				<h3>I have many strengths as a web programmer. First, I enjoy web development, and I’m very active in learning and applying new languages. Now I’m also studying JavaScript frameworks such as React, Angular and Vue. Second, I am very dedicated and responsible. I complete tasks given to me within provided deadline. At Algonquin I submitted all my assignments on time and achieved excellent grades (Cumulative GPA 3.83). Third, I am always ready to learn. If I need additional skills, I am confident that I can learn them quickly. Finally, I am a great team player.</h3>
				<h3>My technical and non-technical skills and my character match very well with the position in your company. I look forward to working with new colleagues, learning a great deal in the position, and growing professionally.</h3>
				<h3>Thank you for your time, and I welcome the opportunity to introduce myself in person (or online).</h3>
				<br>
				<h3>With best regards,</h3>
